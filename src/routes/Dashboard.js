              <p>Hello, we've moved to version 0.1.1</p>

              <p>
                In this version, changes were made to the adding and editing
                spots functionality. Geocoding was disabled from the app some
                time ago, Adding a Spot and Editing a Spot needed changed to
                accept empty parameters for the values that were previously
                generated by this costly API.

                In the next update you should expect a feature to pull the
                coordinates from your phone/machine's connection location into
                adding or editing a ticket with a button.
