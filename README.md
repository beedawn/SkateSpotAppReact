# Skatespot App 

This is a React and Firebase web app designed to have a user login, and allow users to have CRUD capacities on the spots they post. 

## Description

This application uses the GoogleMaps API to provide a map and allow users to pinpoint GPS locations. Additionally, it will gather the users location and frame the map relevant to their location. For example, if you live in New York, New York, and you opened this web app, the app would present you with a view of the map with a 500 mile radius of New York city. It additionally allows users to save and share these locations. They can choose to have a spot be publicly visable, or share it with other users that have signed up for the app. When sharing you would be presented a list of available users from a drop down. Posts and Spot information is stored in a Firebase database. Pictures are stored in Firebase Document Storage.
